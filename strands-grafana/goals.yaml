# Strands Project Goals Configuration
# These thresholds appear as goal lines in Grafana dashboards
# Edit values here and run `strands-metrics load-goals` to update
#
# NOTE: Only rate/percentage/time-based metrics have goals.
# Count-based metrics (open PRs, contributors, etc.) are excluded
# because they scale with the number of repos selected.
